# {frontmatter.title}

This is the layout I start with for almost every new project I begin. The concept is simple: a header, a main content container, and a footer, while ensuring a minimum height that fills the screen, with the main content filling the remaining space.

I don’t enjoy writing vanilla CSS, so I will use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) in this article, though the general concepts apply to all CSS frameworks.

It’s relatively simple; I’m just writing this post to keep a record of it.

## The Basics

To start, we need a root container for the header, main, and footer. While we could use the body tag, I prefer using a dedicated element (like a div) instead, as body is a single, global element.

```html
<html>
  <head>
   ...
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
      <header>...</header>
      <main>...</main>
      <footer>...</footer>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now, we have the basic structure in place. Let’s move on to writing the styles.

### Step 1: Full-Screen Height

We want the root container to take up the full screen height. In Tailwind, we can achieve this by applying the `"min-h-screen"` class.
In addition to `"min-h-screen"`, you can also use other CSS height units like `svh`, `lvh`, or `dvh` for more precise control over screen height.

```html
<div class="min-h-screen">
  <header>...</header>
  <main>...</main>
  <footer>...</footer>
</div>
```

### Step 2: Main Content Growing

To ensure that the main content fills the remaining space, we can apply the `"flex-grow"` class to the main element.

```html
<div class="min-h-screen">
  <header>...</header>
  <main class="flex-grow">...</main>
  <footer>...</footer>
</div>
```

And that's it, you have a layout.
Ok I know this is simple.

## Handling Nested Elements

What if you have another element inside `<main>` that you want to stretch and fill the available space? Simply using `"h-full"` wouldn’t work, so we need to apply flexbox principles deeper into the layout.

```html
<div class="min-h-screen">
  <header>...</header>
  <main class="flex-grow flex flex-col">
    <div>stuff</div>
    <div class="flex-grow">filler</div>
    <div>other stuff</div>
  </main>
  <footer>...</footer>
</div>
```

and so on.

## Fixed Main Height with Scrollable Content

What if you want the main content to have a fixed height but still be scrollable while taking up the remaining space? 
Due to the nature of flexbox, it will overflow, and we need to adjust to that.
The default min-width value for an element is 0 (zero), and for flex items it is auto. This can make elements take up much more space than desired, resulting in overflow.
So the solution here is to set `min-width` back to 0.

```html
<div class="min-h-screen">
  <header>...</header>
  <main class="flex-grow flex flex-col min-h-0">
    ...
  </main>
  <footer>...</footer>
</div>
```

and that's it.
